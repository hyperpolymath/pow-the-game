:toc: auto

== Current Status

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Project specification will be uploaded shortly.*

This repository is currently in early infrastructure setup. No application code or game design documents exist yet.
====

== What Exists

=== Infrastructure (Complete)
* [x] Repository initialization
* [x] Multi-forge mirroring (GitHub → GitLab, Codeberg, Bitbucket)
* [x] Instant-sync workflow for private infrastructure
* [x] Language policy established (Hyperpolymath Standard)
* [x] License declared (AGPL-3.0-or-later)

=== Development Standards (Established)
* Primary language: *ReScript* (compiles to JS)
* Systems/performance: *Rust*
* Runtime: *Deno* (not Node.js)
* Mobile: *Tauri 2.0+* or *Dioxus*
* Backend services: *Gleam*
* Package management: *Guix* (primary), *Nix* (fallback)

== Planned Phases

=== Phase 1: Project Foundation
* [ ] Create project structure (src/, lib/, tests/)
* [ ] Initialize package management (guix.scm, deno.json)
* [ ] Set up development environment
* [ ] Create STATE.scm, META.scm, ECOSYSTEM.scm

=== Phase 2: Game Design
* [ ] Upload game specification document
* [ ] Define proof-of-work game mechanics
* [ ] Design core gameplay loop
* [ ] Establish asset requirements

=== Phase 3: Implementation
* [ ] Core game engine (ReScript/Rust)
* [ ] Game logic and mechanics
* [ ] User interface
* [ ] Testing framework

=== Phase 4: Distribution
* [ ] Desktop builds
* [ ] Mobile builds (Tauri 2.0+/Dioxus)
* [ ] Web deployment

== Contributing

Contribution guidelines will be established once the project specification is uploaded.
